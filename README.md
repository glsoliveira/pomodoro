The React Pomodoro project is a time management application inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. The main goal of this project is to help users improve their productivity and manage their time effectively.

The application allows users to set a specific work duration, typically 25 minutes, known as a "pomodoro." Users can customize the duration based on their preferences. When the pomodoro starts, a countdown timer is displayed, indicating the remaining time for the work session.

Once the work session is completed, the application automatically switches to a short break timer, typically 5 minutes, to provide a quick rest and recharge. After the break, the cycle repeats, alternating between work sessions and short breaks.

The React Pomodoro project also includes additional features to enhance the user experience. Users can adjust the timer settings, pause or resume the timer as needed, and track their progress throughout the work sessions. Visual and audio notifications can be incorporated to alert users when a pomodoro or break is starting or ending
